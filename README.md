# advent-of-code-solutions-2022
I managed to complete every single advent of code challenge from 2022, so I decided to post all my solutions in this repository. Some are better than others :P
All my solutions are written in NodeJS. I found most of the challenges pretty simple, so next year I will write it in a different language. Right now I'm thinking maybe C++ or Rust.
